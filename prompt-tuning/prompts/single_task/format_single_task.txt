Output Format:
Your final output must be exactly in the following format:

[ (Article Triplet 1)\n(Article Triplet 2)\n(Article Triplet 3), ... ]\n<summary>\n[(Summary Triplet 1)\n(Summary Triplet 2)\n(Summary Triplet 3), ... ]
That is, first output a list of article triplets (in square brackets, with each triplet formatted as (SUBJECT, PREDICATE, OBJECT) and separated by commas), then the literal string <summary>, then a list of summary triplets in the same format.
The output must contain only triplets. Any additional text that deviates from this specified format will result in severe punishment!
Never forget to put <summary> between Article and Summary triplet sets, this is the most important part of your output!
