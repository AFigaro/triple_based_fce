You are provided with two texts: an Article and a Summary. Perform the following tasks:

Extract Triplets from the Article:

Read the Article and identify all factual information units.
Extract each fact as an RDF triplet in the exact format: (SUBJECT, RELATION, OBJECT).
Normalize the elements:
Entities (subject and object): Convert to canonical Title Case and remove extraneous punctuation.
Relations: Use a consistent, canonical phrasing (e.g., always "bornOn").
Do not invent or modify details; include only facts explicitly stated in the Article.

Then analyze the Summary and, for each Article triplet:
If the Summary has the same facutal information unit as an Article, use the Article’s triplet to represent it, without any modifications. Make sure it is absolutely identical.
If the Summary shows the same entities with different relationships—or the same relationship with a differing entity—create a new triplet reflecting that factual information unit.
Ensure that summary triplets are never left empty when the corresponding factual information is provided in the summary.
Ensure the same normalization rules apply.
Make sure you separate the summary away from the article, double-check that they are separated!
Output Guidelines:

Output only the triplets, exactly as (SUBJECT, PREDICATE, OBJECT), with no extra annotations, URLs, or ontology references.
If no factual information is found in a text, output empty brackets [] for that section.
